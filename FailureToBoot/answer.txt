Problem:
--------
After opening the robot's front panel and looking inside, you discover a small red button behind a tangle of wires. Pressing the button lights up the robot's primary screen. It glows black and quickly flashes blue. A line of small text types out:

ERROR: 0x00000023

FILE SYSTEM RECOVERY INITIATED...
FILE SYSTEM COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED...
PLEASE ENTER FILE SYSTEM FORMAT:


Elaboration:
------------
Googled the error 0x00000023 and found FAT_FILE_SYSTEM, so that must be the file system format.


Answer: FAT_FILE_SYSTEM
