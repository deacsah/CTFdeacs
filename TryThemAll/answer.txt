Problem:
--------
You have found a passwd file containing salted passwords. An unprotected configuration file has revealed a salt of 2597. The hashed password for the 'admin' user appears to be b587e9e03ec0e073b34fd85858370d2b, try to brute force this password.


Elaboration:
-------------
Looks like we're going to do some bruteforcing with hashcat. Lets find out what hash we've got here (looks like md5 but lets be sure). I used hash-identifier (~$ hash-identifier) to identify the hash, and yep, it's an MD5 hash.

We know there is a salt, so we will be specifying the hash type as either 10 (MD5($password.$salt) or 20 (MD5($salt.$password).

Hashcat expects the imput file to have the following format: hash:salt (see hash.txt)

Downloaded the rockyou-50.txt password list from: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords

deacsah@kali:~/hashcat -m 10 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hash.txt rockyou-50.txt
