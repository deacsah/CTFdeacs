Problem:

	You have found a passwd file containing salted passwords. An unprotected configuration file has revealed a salt of 2597. The hashed password for the 'admin' user appears to be b587e9e03ec0e073b34fd85858370d2b, try to brute force this password.


Elaboration:

	Looks like we're going to do some hashcat stuff: hashcat m 10
