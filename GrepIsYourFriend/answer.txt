Problem:

After plugging the robot into the computer, the robot asks for the name of a file containing the string SECRET AUTH CODE. You can find it using the command-line interface in /problems/grep.tar or by downloading all of the files (grep.tar).

Elaboration:

Created a bash script to loop through items in grep.tar and search for "SECRET AUTH CODE".
If found, the script outputs the filename where the pattern is found

Output:

SECRET AUTH CODES
found pattern in : fHYYpdrfeOCHyQicfe96xfw==

Answer: fHYYpdrfeOCHyQicfe96xfw==
