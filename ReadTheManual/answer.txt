Problem:
--------
On the back of the broken panel you see a recovery manual. You need to find the emergency repair key in order to put the robot into autoboot mode, but it appears to be ciphered using a Caesar cipher.


Elaboration:
------------
Firstly, I created a python script to download the ciphertext for further processing (importCaesarCipher.py).

Secondly, I created a python script to decipher the caesars ciphertext (decipher.py). The algorithm to decipher is straight forward, but you need to find out how many steps were used when creating the ciphertext.

Found the word "Ceehu'i". Words in english that have an apostrophe followed by a letter, are usually prossesive pronouns that end with an "s".

letter 's' = position 19
letter 'i' = position 9

(19 + x) % 26 = 9
x = 16

Entered 16 in as the amount of steps, and BAM. Text was deciphered (deciphered.txt). Answer is now readable in plain text.
